\chapter*{Disclaimer}

This version of textbook is based on Prof. Shindou's lecture notes on Quantum Statistical Physics. The original manuscript is a hand-written one and makes it difficult to search or jump between sections. Hence we several students make a \LaTeX version. 

\ 

Definitely, this draft contains numerous deficiency including typing errors or other confusing errors. If any reader of this notes found something incorrect comparing with the original hand-written one, please send us emails to report. We would like to enhance. So far, we appreciate the help from Xiao-Tian Zhang, Hao Liang. Both of them correct typos of this notes. 

\ 

Also, this version contains another significant bug (which is waiting for you to fix): for a same notation in different part of the note, it could be represented by differnt way, say $x, \bf{x}$ may be same thing but the former one mainly shows in chapter 1 and the later one may be shown up otherwise. 

\
